## üõ† Usage Instructions

### First Run
When running the program for the first time, it will automatically create the following files:
- `config.yaml` - Seat layout configuration file
- `people.csv` - Student list template file

The program interface includes:
- Toolbar: Random sorting, configuration editing, random seed input, layout export
- Podium area: Displays "Podium" text
- Seating area: Displays student seats in the format "ID Name (Row,Column)"

### Configuring Classroom Layout
1. Click the "Edit Configuration" button to open the `config.yaml` file
2. Modify the configuration and save the file
3. Click the "Random Sort" button again to apply the new configuration

### Adding Student Information
1. Edit the `people.csv` file
2. Add student information according to the format
3. Click the "Random Sort" button again to apply the new student list

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File Details

The program uses a YAML format configuration file `config.yaml`, located in the program's running directory. Below is a detailed configuration explanation:

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
layout:
  rows: 3      # Number of rows in the classroom
  columns: 4   # Number of columns in the classroom
```

- `rows`: Defines the number of rows in the classroom, counted from the podium downward
- `columns`: Defines the number of columns in the classroom, counted from left to right

Note: The program automatically adds an aisle (empty column) after every two seat columns, so the actual displayed number of columns will be greater.

### Excluded Seats Configuration
```yaml
disabled_seats:
  - [0, 0]        # Specifies which position is unavailable
```

- `disabled_seats`: A list specifying which seats cannot be used.
- Example: `[0, 0]` indicates the seat in the first row (from top) and first column (from left) is unavailable.
- Typically used to avoid windows, doors, or other obstacles.

### Aisle Configuration
```yaml
aisles:
  columns:
    - [1, 2]
  rows:
    - [1, 2]
```

- `columns`: Indicates between which columns an aisle exists, e.g., `[1, 2]` means an aisle exists between the 2nd and 3rd columns (from left)
- `rows`: Indicates between which rows an aisle exists, e.g., `[1, 2]` means an aisle exists between the 2nd and 3rd rows (from top)

### Complete Configuration Example
```yaml
layout:
  rows: 3
  columns: 4
disabled_seats:
  - [0, 0]
aisles:
  columns:
    - [1, 2]
  rows:
    - [1, 2]
```

## üìÑ Student List Format

The student list uses CSV format, named `student.csv` (if not specified otherwise in the configuration), with the following format:

```
Number,Name,Sex
1,Zhang San,Male
2,Li Si,Female
3,Wang Wu,Male
4,Zhao Liu,Female
```

- Must contain three columns: Number, Name, Sex (ID, Name, Gender)
- When gender is "male" or "female", the seat border will be colored accordingly, but this does not affect the "same-gender seat pairing" functionality.

- The program automatically generates a CSV file containing 8 example students on first run.

## üì§ Exporting Seat Layout
1. After completing the random seat arrangement
2. Click the "Export Current Layout" button
3. Select the save location and file name
4. Click "Save" to complete the export

The exported XLSX spreadsheet contains the podium and all seats, which can be used for editing, printing, or sharing.
